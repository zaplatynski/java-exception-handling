# The Three Golden Rules of Exception Handling

In this chapter we will learn that there are only three basic rules we should follow to do effective Java exception handling better than the average. The basis for this was written down by Chris Adamson in December 2003 at [Today Java](http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2003/12/04/exceptions.html). In short these three rules are:

1. **Be Specific**
2. **Throw Early**
3. **Catch Late**

In the next paragraphs we will discuss what that means in detail and how it is done.
